In this assignment, I built a web application that showcases my professional portfolio.
I made three different html pages, each with its own distinctive content.
The first page contained my personal information and photo, the second contained my portfolio information while the last one contained a form to let the user contact me if needed.
I utilized the Bootstrap online tool to import certain CSS properties for the pages and also to make the application mobile responsive.
I also added my own CSS file to customize the pages to my preference.
I customized the Nav bar such that all the pages are properly linked together; in other words, a user can easily access any of the three pages by clicking the relevant links on the Nav bar.
Lastly I used an online HTML validation tool to ensure that the HTML code is error-free.
